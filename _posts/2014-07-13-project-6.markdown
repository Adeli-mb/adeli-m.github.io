description:
Project required designing a single gear transmission for a small aircraft, connecting an engine to a propeller head. The unit was to be designed to have a life of 2000 hours and maximum power of 50hp. It was required to be made for mass production.tion.
<br />


How
Initially hand calculations were undertaken to understand the forces that key components could withstand. The values attained were cross referenced against GP 100 and Romax software to judge accuracy. The software found created a more accurate gear ratio. The results produced influenced the materials used and the design configuration in the first design.

<h2>Results</h2> 
The final design incorporated a design for assembly and manufacturing analysis, resulting in major adjustments being made to our design both internally and externally. This lead to the eradication of non-essential parts and design changes to allow for easy manufacturing. Weight was reduced by 20%, and parts were optimized boosting performance.
